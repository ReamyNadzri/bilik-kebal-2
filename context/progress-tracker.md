# Progress Tracker

Update this file after every meaningful implementation or specification change.

## Current Phase

- Phased MVP design review and implementation-plan preparation.

## Current Goal

- Review the written phased MVP design, then produce a task-by-task implementation plan for Claude Code or another agentic worker.

## Completed

- Read and visually reviewed the 24-page `BILIK KEBAL 2 by afes.pdf` proposal.
- Defined VAULTIX as a production-oriented, UiTM-first, English-first academic resource bounty marketplace.
- Confirmed that any email may register but email verification is mandatory.
- Separated email verification from institution verification; the star emblem represents institution verification.
- Limited transactional, claim, and resource access to institution-verified users while allowing verified-email browsing.
- Confirmed that one student account may act as Commissioner, Backer, and Hunter.
- Selected ToyyibPay for payment collection with disabled, sandbox, and allowlisted live-limited modes.
- Defined RM1-RM50 contributions, payer-borne gateway fees, and a configurable 10% fee snapshotted at publication.
- Defined manual Owner payout and refund operations for the first release.
- Defined 7-, 14-, and 30-day bounty durations, no extension, and full manual refunds after unfulfilled expiry.
- Defined one best winning claim, with submission time used only as a tie-breaker.
- Defined one seven-day appeal reviewed by a different Sheriff and paused expiry/refund during appeal.
- Defined contributor-only access by default and rights-approved free release 48 hours after approval.
- Defined supported file types, 50 MB maximum, quarantine, duplicate strategy, reports, takedown, and retention.
- Defined Owner, Platform Sheriff, and institution-scoped Sheriff permissions.
- Selected a Supabase-centric architecture, with Supabase Storage first and an optional Cloudflare R2 hybrid path later.
- Selected Resend for custom transactional SMTP.
- Selected Supabase Queues and Cron for durable background work and scheduled lifecycle tasks.
- Assigned detailed visual design to a separate designer; recorded only product direction and accessibility constraints.
- Populated all six context files. No application code or scaffold has been created.
- Renamed the product identity from WANTED to VAULTIX while retaining `Wanted` as a marketplace feature term.
- Approved a six-phase full-MVP direction: Foundation; Identity and institution trust; Wanted marketplace and money; Claims and moderation; Fulfilment and operations; Hardening and controlled launch.
- Approved a `pnpm`-managed single Next.js App Router modular monolith with Supabase as the source of truth and provider integrations behind typed adapters.
- Wrote `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-13-vaultix-mvp-design.md` as the phased MVP design handoff.
- Assigned the complete provisional MVP frontend to Claude Code and backend/infrastructure implementation to Codex, with separate worktrees and Codex-owned shared contracts.

## In Progress

- Preparation of coordinated frontend and backend implementation plans.

## Next Up

1. Write and review the coordinated implementation plans in small vertical feature units.
2. Initialise the repository/tooling and execute the plan phase by phase.
4. Incorporate the external visual design handoff into `ui-context.md` when it is available.
5. Resolve the remaining launch-gate decisions before enabling their affected public capabilities.

## Open Questions

### Critical Before Public Launch

- Name the legal platform operator and ToyyibPay merchant account owner for Terms, Privacy Notice, receipts, payout, and complaints.
- Confirm ToyyibPay's live callback security contract, merchant fees, refund route, settlement behaviour, and access to any payout/disbursement API.
- Obtain legal/provider review of funds flow, liability treatment, refunds/chargebacks, takedown, copyright, PDPA obligations, taxation, and retention.
- Confirm official UiTM email domains and the evidence accepted for manual institution verification.
- Select the authoritative UiTM campus/faculty/programme/course taxonomy source and the staff member allowed to maintain it.
- Select and fund the isolated scanning worker/provider before public uploads are enabled.
- Decide the paid or otherwise compliant Vercel/Supabase production arrangements before public commercial use.
- Receive the external designer's final tokens, assets, responsive screens, and state designs.

### Can Be Resolved During Implementation Planning

- Select the exact error-tracking provider and retention settings.
- Select the scanner container host and document-conversion toolchain.
- Define the initial moderation reason-code catalogue and institution-specific policy flags.
- Define the final legal metadata-retention periods after professional review.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Supabase-centric first:** one managed platform reduces initial setup and operational burden. Storage records include a provider field so R2 can be introduced later without rewriting Claim or Entitlement logic.
- **Modular monolith:** domains remain isolated in code and data contracts without premature microservices.
- **Separate scanner worker:** large untrusted-file processing is not suitable for Vercel or Supabase Edge Function limits.
- **PostgreSQL source of truth:** financial and access relationships require transactions, constraints, and auditable relational state.
- **Immutable ledger:** refunds, chargebacks, fees, and corrections are compensating entries rather than edits.
- **Manual money release first:** Owner records payout/refund performed outside the system until provider automation is validated.
- **Human moderation:** automated screening prioritises and supplies evidence but never approves or finally rejects a claim.
- **Configuration snapshots:** fee, access basis, duration, policy version, and relevant limits are preserved per bounty/claim so later patches do not rewrite historical obligations.
- **Free tiers for controlled testing:** free infrastructure is acceptable for development and invited tests; public commercial use requires launch-gate review and appropriate service plans.

## Session Notes

- The workspace is a Git repository on `main`, tracking `origin/main` on GitLab.
- The user authorised the assistant to choose safe non-critical technical defaults and only escalate critical product, money, legal, privacy, ownership, migration, or recurring-cost decisions.
- The user wants patch-by-patch delivery and expects setup/navigation guidance for Supabase, Vercel, Cloudflare, Resend, and ToyyibPay when implementation begins.
- The current approved storage choice is Supabase Storage. Cloudflare R2 is a future hybrid option, not a current dependency.
- `Live Limited` may use real ToyyibPay payments for controlled tester accounts, with RM1-RM50 contributions and no platform-wide daily cap.
- Public upload remains disabled until a production scanning worker is available.
- The user approved phased full-MVP development and separate Claude frontend/Codex backend ownership. Application coding begins after the relevant phase plan is written.
